# Stairs of Remorse

## What I want to build
I am building a fitness challenge application for people that like to push themselves beyond their limits.

## More Detailed Description
Working stairs is an accessible, yet often overlooked way to get a great workout. This app helps people by providing workouts, a way to track them and compete with others.

## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)
My personal motivation for this application is that I am in the middle of a fitness journey myself. This week I got an amazing outdoor workout on a 30 meter stairs at a park nearby that I had never done before, and am thrilled to do it more often.

Besides scratching my own itch, I think an app like this may prove to stimulate people to improve their overall fitness, without the barrier of having to go to a gym. These exercises could be done from the comfort of their own home, apartment building or neighborhood.

## How will you utilize RedwoodJS?
RedwoodJS would be used for both the `web` and `api` side. With a bigger emphasis on the web side. The framework has been my go-to as my tech stack. My setup would be as follows:
- Self hosted on an Ubuntu server
- Postgres as the database
- DBAuth for authentication
- MantineJS as the UI framework
- Use the CLI generators for Rapid Application Development (RAD)
